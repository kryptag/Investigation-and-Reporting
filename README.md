# Investigation-and-Reporting


* A list of all Google queries you made to solve it, and timestamps (just copy it from the browser history)
* A list all pages you visited to solve it (just copy it from the browser history)
* A list of the 3 most biggest stumbling blocks you came across and your reflection on why they were problematic (did you misunderstand     something, was some of the info you found wrong, did you miss a detail, …)
* A brief “every 30 min” diary as explained in the slides (this is more frequent than one would normally do, and is just meant as part of   the exercise)
